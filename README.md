Aviation Risk Analysis

Project Overview

This project aims to analyze aviation accident data to assess the risk associated with different aircraft. The goal is to provide actionable insights to help a company make informed decisions on purchasing low-risk aircraft for commercial and private aviation expansion.

Dataset
Source: Aviation accident dataset with 88,889 records and 31 attributes.
Attributes Include:
Aircraft specifications
Accident severity
Operational factors
Environmental conditions

Objectives
Identify aircraft models with the lowest accident risk.
Analyze key factors contributing to aviation accidents.
Assess accident severity trends based on operational and environmental conditions.

Technologies Used
Python
Pandas
NumPy
Matplotlib & Seaborn
Jupyter Notebook

Project Structure
Project Notebook.ipynb: Jupyter Notebook with data analysis and visualizations.
AviationData.csv: Dataset containing aviation accident records.

README.md: Project documentation.
How to Run the Analysis
Install required libraries:
pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn
Open Project Notebook.ipynb in Jupyter Notebook.
Run the notebook cells to load, clean, and analyze the data.

Load Data

import pandas as pd
# Read the AviationData using pandas
df = pd.read_csv("AviationData.csv", encoding="latin1")
# Display the last 5 rows of the data
df.tail()

Check Missing Values

# Check the null values and get the percentage
missing_percent = df.isnull().sum() / len(df) * 100
print(missing_percent.sort_values(ascending=False))

Basic Data Insights

# Display dataset information
df.info()

# Display summary statistics
df.describe()

Insights & Findings

Highlights key contributing factors such as weather, aircraft age, and operational procedures.
Provides recommendations for aircraft purchase based on risk assessment.
Future Improvements
Incorporate machine learning models for predictive risk analysis.
Enhance data visualization with interactive dashboards.
Include real-time aviation data for dynamic risk assessment
